        <h4>What is DnD?</h4>
        <p>DnD stands for Dungeons and Dragons. DnD is a roleplaying tabletop game made by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. Players play as their own made up characters and one player called a Dungeon Master creates scenarios and situations all other players have to go through.</p>
    <h4>About the DnD Club in Clogher Road Community College</h4>
        <p>The DnD club was setup by our librarian Neil Kettles. We typically play a couple of hours once a day each month and pick up from where we left of in the next month. There are two seperate groups that play each month. Harry is our Dungeon Master.</p>
