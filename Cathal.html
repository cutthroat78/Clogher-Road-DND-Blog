        <h4>The dim-witted adventures of Lonklir and Hemlock Part 1</h4>
        <p>Hello, I am Hemlock Gremlock, successor to the legendary Shmemlock Gremlock (no relation, I earned the name gremlock, it was not my birth right). I'm a warlock on the Pact of the Chain, but until now you would not have known that from my daily grind, as I'm also a farmer for my village. I am well known in my village for being both a warlock and a farmer. I would do anything for my village. My only friend outside of the village is Lonklir Bronzeton. We became friends when I agreed to supply him with my village's finest ale.</p>
        <p>Anyway, today I found a letter upon my doorstep. It was from a loan shark that I acquired money from in order to finance my farm. He asked that I meet him in a library, located a bit away from my village. I complied with his request, and when I arrived I was greeted by a tall, slender man who brought me to a room with people I didn't recognize. I was slightly uneasy until Lonklir entered drunk, but for him not nearly drunk enough. I decided to see if I could spot anything extraordinary, and I noticed I was not alone in doing this - a dwarf and an elf seemed to be preforming arcane checks</p>
        <p>The loan shark entered and informed everyone that they owe him a favour. He wished for us to acquire an elixir of undying from a well-known sorcerer on his behalf. Everyone agreed but some people felt unease by his lack of specifics. Lonklir attempted to refill his flask and on his way out he confronted the loan shark, and was informed that any deviation from the plan will be punished with death.</p>
        <p>On the way to the sorcerer's house, lonklir treated his drunkenness with a coffee while the others got to know each other: Squish the dwarf (a fellow warlock), Adriana (an elf cleric), Glitch (a half-elf rogue), Amico (a thiefling rogue), and Crurore Gravaltones, or Tony for short (a Halfling bard like Schmemlock).</p>
        <p>When we arrived upon the house, it seemed well kept with a large walled perimeter. Luckily some people had dungeoneer's packs and were able to get a rope to help everyone up. Tony had the first go getting up and manged to collapse a brick on his nose, but every one eventually made it to the top. On the way down the other side Adriana and myself suffered a fall. When everyone was over the wall we tried to silently observe the house. We now noticed that there was some kind of illusion stopping us from seeing that the house was not well kept and actually appeared abandoned. We could not think for too long about this because a knight we assumed to be a decoration turned-out to be a magical security system. Wasting no time Lonklir bravely ran into battle with Tony ripping him an epic ballad to fight along with. He grabbed his trident and he thrust it as hard as he could at the knight. He hit the knight's shoulder, barely damaging it, and the knight fought back with devastating two punches to the ribs and then the head, almost collapsing Lonklir. Adriana then attempted to heal Tony of the damage sustained by his run in with the brick. I then dealt some serious damage with an Eldritch blast. Amico and Glitch try to advance upon the knight. Adriana then blasted fire at the knight, hurting it. Squish foolishly advanced, followed by Amico and Glitch who dealt some damage in the process. I then visually overwhelmed the knight with a minor illusion in an attempt to stop him from hitting my very foolish new friends.</p>
        <p>It worked: Glitch ended the fight with a deadly strike from behind</p>
        <p>Everyone entered the house. My fellow hafling and I ran up steps to checkout a giant elk skeleton on display. I anticipated an attack and attempted to tackle the elk, accidently mounting it as I expected the elk began to move along with many other skeleton animal replicates on display in the room Lonklir attacked the elk, chopping off one horn. In anger the elk threw me off and kicked Tony through a banister to the ground where he was knocked out. Lonklir jumped down to protect him from skeletons and Amico came to my rescue by killing the undead deer. Squish, Glitch and Adriana were surrounded and being attacked by skeleton animals. I used my cunning and determined that the elk was standing on a pressure plate. That was the trigger that set off the skeleton animals. I communicated this to Amico and we both step on it, killing all of the skeletons. We use the bones to keep the pressure plate down.</p>
        <p>We start grabbing what we can from this room. I got desert armour, Squish grabs blizzard armour. Squish and Lonklir share knowledge of the artefacts, and come to a deduction that the sorcerer has been to the planes. Then Tony awoke and heard a voice coming from the cupboard. He opened the cupboard and a small figure ran by him. I used minor illusion to sooth the figure and lonklir offered him booze. I talked to him, and he told me that he is the assistant to the sorcerer and that the sorcerer is in trouble. He was working with portals to make travel easier but there was an accident. I used my powers of deceit to convince him that we were here to help and that we needed his other project, the elixir, to help him. He fell for it and we now have a Sherpa to help navigate the house. we entered the dining hall, and rest to be continued...</p>
